I'm a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in **Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering** at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey University in the city of Monterrey, Mexico.

## My passions

I'm heavily passionate on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics and Aerospace Engineering. 

## I'm currently working on

My projects range from **natural language processing** and **large language models** capable of producing generative responses to user queries to **object recognition, obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation** in vehicles such as boats.

## I'm currently learning...

- Cross-platform development of apps for mobile, web, desktop and embedded devices with **Dart** and **Flutter**.
- Processing of data from object and environment scanners for the generation of **point clouds for object detection, classification and segementation for self-driving vehicles**.
- Python language tools for **perception and computer vision algorithms** for autonomous vehicles.
- **Robot Operating System 2** and its C++ and Python dependencies.

## My projects

### Black Box

Black Box was a project developed during the 2022 edition of the HackMTY hackathon that gave us the first place in the insurance company CHUBB's challenge on methods of guaranteeing security to users in the Metaverse. The project consisted of a prototype of a digital and smart wallet that allows its users to access financial services through multiple layers of authentication such as a physical key and passwords.

In this project, I supported my colleagues in the physical design of the project through Computer Aided Design and its three-dimensional printing, the connection of electronic components for their operation and in the creation of views and serializers of the Django project of the solution for establishing APIs and linking them to a graphical user interface created with React.

### Xandria

Xandria was a project developed during the 2023 edition of the HackMTY hackathon that gave us an honorable mention in the challenge of the technological and software solutions company Sofftek on a general-purpose search engine. The project consisted of a search engine powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) and a vector database for storing PDF documents.

In this project, I supported my colleagues in designing the overall functioning of the search engine and its individual components. It required an investigation of the Python framework called Langchain and the implementation of a Large Language Model called Falcon built on top of the Meta LLaMA LLM, Hugging Face and ChromaDB. Finally, I co-designed the functionality of the application and assisted in writing the program that deploys generative responses to user queries related to the content of pre-loaded PDF files loaded during use.
