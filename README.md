## 🤖 My Projects

* **Puzzlebot Challenge**: A differential drive robot provided by ![Manchester Robotics Ltd.](https://github.com/ManchesterRoboticsLtd) with a closed-loop PID control system and computer vision algorithms capable of autonomous navigation and object recognition.
* **NAO Telepresence System**: Telepresence system based on the humanoid NAO robot that enables a user to remotely see, hear, and control itself as if it were present physically inside the NAO.
* **RoboMaster TT Drone**: Drone project to be made.
* **Autonomous Tractor Waypoint Navigation**: Autonomous tractor prototype with wireless communication for waypoint data management from camera-based GPS, local motion tracking from IMU, and encoder interface for travelled distance estimation.
* **Tractor Sprayer Control Systems**: PID controllers of a DC motor mounted on a 3D printed base using analog and digital electronics for computerized irrigation solution. The analog version consisted of using magnetic encoder, operational amplifiers, and potentiometers to compare a reference signal and a feedback signal whose error was minimized with the PID controller. The digital version used the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence system identification technique to estimate the DC motor model with the data captured by the encoder, System Identification to estimate a transfer function model, and PID Tuner to generate a PID controller.
* **Intelligent Tractor Driving System**: Embedded system prototype for an automatic transmission controller for an agricultural tractor with RaspberryPi, STM32, and FreeRTOS.
* **Tractor Simulator**: 3D tractor driving simulator made with the Unity game engine, a DE10-Lite FPGA board configured via VHDL in Intel Quartus Prime, and C# programming.
* **AquaNet**: IoT system designed to regulate and maintain optimal environmental conditions for pet fish in aquariums through multiple specialized sensors like temperature, pH, ultrasonic, time, and light sensors and water heater, water pump, servomotor, solenoid valve, and RGB multi-color LED strip actuators.
* **Xandria Search Engine**: Advanced search engine that leveraged a large language model (Falcon LLM) and a vector database (Chroma DB) for document queries. Awarded Honorable Mention in Software Solutions Sponsor Business Softtek's Hackathon Challenge during HackMTY 2023.
* **BlackBox Digital Wallet**: Smart digital wallet prototype for wireless financial services with access layered through authentication with Python Django and React framework. Awarded 1st Place in Insurance Sponsor Business CHUBB’s Hackathon Challenge during HackMTY 2022.
